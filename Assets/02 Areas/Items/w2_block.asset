  ThermalConductivity: 4
  IsolationValue: 0
  PressureResistance: 8
  ElectricalConductivity: 6
  VibrationValue: 9
  ThermalError: I can't squash this block enough, to fit it into the cooling tank.
  IsolationError: The block doesn't seem dense enough to block radiation.
  PressureError: 
  ConductivityError: This block has no electrical conductivity. It's actually a good
    isolator.
  VibrationError:
